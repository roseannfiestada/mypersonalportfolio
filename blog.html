                        Hey there,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to share my journey of switching gears in my career. It's not the kind of story you'd usually hear in a corporate setting, but it's my story, and I hope it inspires you to chase your dreams too.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For years, I was the go-to person for all things administrative. You needed a spreadsheet sorted and a stack of papers organized? I was your guy. It was a stable gig, and I was good at it. But, like many people, I reached a point where I craved something more. Something different. Something challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I tried to explore web development and software testing. Yep, I decided to dive headfirst into the tech world. Now, I know what you're thinking: "But you didn't have any experience!" And you're right, I didn't. But what I did have was determination, a passion for problem-solving, and a willingness to learn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, I started learning. I hit the websites and online courses, and I embraced the world of coding. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python - they became my new friends. And let me tell you, it was tough. There were moments when I wanted to throw my laptop out the window. But I didn't. I persevered.
                    </p>
                <img class="blog_photo2" src="photos/blog (3).jpg" alt="photo2">
                    <p>
                        I built my first website, this website. It wasn't fancy, but it worked. That feeling of accomplishment, of creating something from scratch, was addictive. I wanted more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As for software testing, I realized it was like being a detective in the digital world. I hunted for bugs, glitches, and inconsistencies. It required attention to detail, patience, and a curious mind - qualities I honed during my days in administrative tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I didn't just learn the technical stuff, though. I also discovered the power of networking. I joined online tech communities, and connected with people who were light-years ahead of me in the tech game. And you know what? They were incredibly supportive. They shared resources, offered advice, and even gave me a virtual pat on the back when I needed it most.
                    </p>
                    <img class="blog_photo3" src="photos/blog (1).jpg" alt="photo3">
                    <p>
                        Sure, it was a bit scary to leave the comfort of my administrative role, but it was the best decision I ever made. I found a new career that I'm passionate about, and it turns out my administrative skills weren't wasted - they're still handy for keeping things organized in the tech world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So, here I am, a career shifter, proof that it's never too late to chase your dreams. If you're thinking about making a change, my advice is simple: Go for it. Embrace the challenge, learn as much as you can, and don't be afraid to ask for help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Your journey may not be conventional, but it'll be uniquely yours. And who knows, you might just surprise yourself with what you can achieve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Cheers to chasing dreams and never looking back!
